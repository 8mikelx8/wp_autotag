Plugin to automatically generate tags depending on your posts content.

== Description ==

This plugin uses an analysis engine to process the text of the posts and automatically
generate tags for this post. It can save a lot of time if you have to add tags to a lot
of posts and also can show which words appear as relevants in your texts (May be useful in SEO).

== Installation ==


1. Upload WP_autotag.zip
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin stops working after a few seconds, what happens? =

This plugin relies on an external service. Due to the service limitations it only
allows a certain number of queries per minute. The plugin will usually generate tags for
about ten posts each time and you will can execute the plugin again after one minute.

= Do I have to register on monkeylearn for using the plugin? =

The plugin needs a key to work which is provided by monkeylearn, but don't worry,
their service is free unless you want to send more than 1000 queries per month.
